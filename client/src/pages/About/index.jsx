        Anyone from a big family will tell you that important information gets lost constantly in the shuffle of jokes, memes, and tiny, grainy GIFs.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, while it's true that FamFilter was initially designed to keep pertinent information at hand for big families and keep problematic or over-the-top family members in check, this easily moderated message board can easily be used for groups of any size.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here at FamFilter, we strive to clean up communication and streamline what used to be the simple task of announcing a celebration, event, or otherwise worthwhile occasion. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Easily start a new announcement, add a comment to an existing announcement, or delete an irrelevant or troublesome response.         
      </p>
      <p>Happy screening!</p>
